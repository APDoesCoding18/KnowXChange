## **Project Description**

**KnowXChange** is an interactive web platform that allows users to **learn new skills through courses while earning rewards**.  
Each course consists of learning videos and custom assignments such as quizzes and mini-projects to enhance **hands-on practical experience**.  
Gamification is implemented via **SkillCoins**, a reward currency earned by completing assignments. Users can use SkillCoins for various perks, such as buying merchandise, unlocking premium content, or showcasing achievements.  
A leaderboard tracks top learners based on comprehension and engagement, ensuring **quality learning over mere completion**.

This project is built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB**, making it a beginner-friendly yet feature-rich full-stack application.
